# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `npm run changeset` in the root of the repository. This will prompt you to:

1. Select which packages have been changed
2. Choose the type of change (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

## Publishing

Changesets are automatically published when merged to the main branch via GitHub Actions.
The release workflow will:

1. Create a "Version Packages" PR that bumps versions
2. When that PR is merged, publish the packages to npm
